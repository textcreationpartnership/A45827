            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>In Case any Proviso should be offer'd to the Bill of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralization, to oblige the Persons mentioned in the Bill constantly to reside in <hi>England,</hi> it is hoped the same will be rejected for the Reasons following.</head>
            <p n="1">I. NEVER any such Clause was in any Bill of Naturalization before; and new unusual Clauses, in Acts of Parliament, are dangerous.</p>
            <p n="2">II. There is no occasion for any such Clause; no Instance can be given of any Naturaliz'd Person of any Estate considerable that liv'd abroad, and spent his Rents there; or if there should be an Instance or two, that's not enough for this general Restraint.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Such a Clause will hinder Strangers from being Naturaliz'd, which would be a Mischief to the Nation; for these being Men of Fortunes, 'tis good for the Publick to have them come among us.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The Farmer of the Scavidge of the City in the Custom-House of <hi>London,</hi> hath, on other Occasions of Naturalization, done his Endeavour to have a Clause to save the said Scavidge to him; but has always been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanc'd in Parliament.</p>
            <p n="5">V. That this Clause incapacitates them to do his Majesty Service abroad, which they are capable to do.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. That 'tis said, If they shall live abroad with their Family, they shall forfeit their Priviledges: Now what shall be counted their Families is not explained, and they left in the dark as to these Forfeitures.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. When they are Naturaliz'd, they are English Subjects to all Intents and Purposes; and this Clause takes away Liberty and Property from them, which is an ill President as to the rest.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. If this Proviso be inserted in the said Act, those named in it would be troubled every Day abroad by Governors of the Plantations, and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors of the Custom-House there, as likewise by the Consuls in Foreign Places, on pretence, That those named in the said Act are absent from <hi>England,</hi> and therefore these Ships or Effects are Forfeited by the said Clause as absent from <hi>England,</hi> which may be restored on Proof to the contrary: But this would be the utter Ruin of the Ships and Effects seized on, and no Satisfaction for them.</p>
